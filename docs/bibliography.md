## 1. HPC-Enhanced ML Architectures for Phishing Detection

### 1.1. Distributed HPC Pipelines

#### Tutorial: Distributed HPC Pipelines in ML
Distributed HPC pipelines leverage multiple nodes to parallelize ML tasks, such as training, feature extraction, and inference. In phishing detection, this is critical for handling large datasets (e.g., millions of URLs) and complex models (e.g., deep neural networks). A common framework is TensorFlow with data parallelism, where the dataset is split across nodes, and each node trains a model replica on its subset, periodically synchronizing gradients.

**Example:** To detect phishing URLs, a dataset of 10 million URLs is split across 10 HPC nodes. Each node trains a CNN on 1 million URLs, and the gradients are averaged every 100 iterations. This reduces training time from 10 hours (on a single machine) to 1 hour.

**Citation:** This concept is inspired by Brown & Garcia (2024) in "Scalable Phishing Detection with HPC-Enhanced ML," which discusses a TensorFlow-based pipeline on HPC clusters for phishing detection.

### 2.5. Specialized Phishing Detection with HPC

#### Tutorial: Specialized Phishing Detection
Specialized phishing detection targets specific domains like blockchain or multi-vector cyberattacks. HPC enables the processing of complex data (e.g., blockchain transaction graphs) in real time, using models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

**Example:** A GNN on an HPC cluster analyzes Ethereum transaction graphs, identifying phishing wallets by their interaction patterns, processing 1 million transactions per minute.

**Citation:** This concept is inspired by Chen et al. (2023) in "Ethereum Phishing Scam Detection…," which uses a GNN for blockchain phishing detection, scaled with HPC.

#### Open Research Questions:
- How can HPC systems improve the detection of phishing in emerging technologies like Web3 and IoT?
- What are the computational challenges of scaling GNNs for real-time phishing detection in blockchain environments?

## 3. Comprehensive Reviews and Surveys

### 3.1. Reviews on Phishing Detection

#### Tutorial: Reviewing Phishing Detection Literature
Comprehensive reviews provide a historical and technical overview of phishing detection methods, identifying trends, challenges, and future directions. HPC enhances the applicability of these findings by enabling the scaling of reviewed methods for real-time deployment.
