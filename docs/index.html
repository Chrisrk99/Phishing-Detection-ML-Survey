    <h1>The Role of High-Performance Computing in Enhancing Machine Learning for Phishing Detection</h1>

    <p>Phishing attacks remain a formidable cybersecurity threat, relentlessly evolving to outpace traditional detection methods. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a critical countermeasure, enabling proactive and adaptive identification of phishing attempts. Yet, the computational demands of ML—particularly for processing vast datasets or achieving real-time detection—often constrain its effectiveness. High-performance computing (HPC) addresses this bottleneck, delivering the power needed to boost the speed, scalability, and efficiency of ML models. This survey investigates the integration of HPC with ML to tackle phishing detection challenges, focusing on three key areas: ML Implementations on HPC Architectures, Advanced HPC Tools and Technologies, and Impact on Performance Metrics.</p>
