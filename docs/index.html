        <h1>The Role of High-Performance Computing in Enhancing Machine Learning for Phishing Detection</h1>

        <p>Phishing attacks remain a formidable cybersecurity threat, relentlessly evolving to outpace traditional detection methods. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a critical countermeasure, enabling proactive and adaptive identification of phishing attempts. However, the computational demands of ML—particularly for processing vast datasets or achieving real-time detection—often constrain its effectiveness. High-performance computing (HPC) addresses this bottleneck, delivering the power needed to boost the speed, scalability, and efficiency of ML models. This survey investigates the integration of HPC with ML to tackle phishing detection challenges, with a focus on the interplay between HPC architectures, ML methods, and their combined impact on performance.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction to HPC in Phishing Detection</h2>
        <div class="tutorial">
            <h3>Why HPC Matters for Phishing Detection</h3>
            <p>Phishing detection using ML requires processing large volumes of data (e.g., URLs, email content, webpage features) in real time to identify malicious patterns. Traditional computing environments often struggle with the computational intensity of deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially when scaling to enterprise-level applications. HPC addresses these challenges by providing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parallel Processing:</strong> HPC clusters distribute tasks across multiple nodes, enabling simultaneous training and inference on large datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> HPC systems can handle growing datasets and model complexity without sacrificing performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Capabilities:</strong> HPC reduces latency, making it feasible to detect phishing attempts in real time, such as in email gateways or web browsers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider a scenario where an email server processes 1 million emails per hour. A CNN-based phishing detector needs to analyze each email’s content and URLs in under a second. On a single CPU, this might take 5 seconds per email, leading to a backlog. An HPC cluster with 100 nodes can parallelize the task, reducing the processing time to 0.05 seconds per email, enabling real-time detection.</p>
            <div class="illustration-placeholder">
                [Illustration Placeholder: Diagram showing a single CPU vs. an HPC cluster processing emails. The CPU has a long queue, while the HPC cluster processes emails in parallel across nodes.]

                <ul>
                    <li>How can HPC systems be optimized for energy efficiency while maintaining high throughput in phishing detection?</li>
                    <li>What are the trade-offs between model accuracy and latency when scaling HPC resources for real-time applications?</li>
                    <li>How can HPC architectures adapt to evolving phishing techniques, such as adversarial attacks on ML models?</li>

            <div class="tutorial">
                <h4>Tutorial: Distributed HPC Pipelines in ML</h4>
                <p>Distributed HPC pipelines leverage multiple nodes to parallelize ML tasks, such as training, feature extraction, and inference. In phishing detection, this is critical for handling large datasets (e.g., millions of URLs) and complex models (e.g., deep neural networks). A common framework is TensorFlow with data parallelism, where the dataset is split across nodes, and each node trains a model replica on its subset, periodically synchronizing gradients.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> To detect phishing URLs, a dataset of 10 million URLs is split across 10 HPC nodes. Each node trains a CNN on 1 million URLs, and the gradients are averaged every 100 iterations. This reduces training time from 10 hours (on a single machine) to 1 hour.</p>

                <h4>Tutorial: URL-Based Phishing Detection</h4>
                <p>URL-based phishing detection focuses on analyzing the syntactic and semantic features of URLs to identify malicious patterns. HPC enhances this by enabling large-scale processing of URLs with deep learning models like CNNs and LSTMs. A typical pipeline involves tokenizing URLs into character sequences, feeding them into a CNN, and classifying them as phishing or legitimate.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The URL “http://paypa1.com/login” is tokenized into characters: [h, t, t, p, :, /, /, p, a, y, p, a, 1, ., c, o, m, /, l, o, g, i, n]. A CNN trained on an HPC cluster analyzes this sequence, detecting the misspelling “paypa1” (mimicking “paypal”) as a phishing indicator.</p>

            <h3>4.3. Comparison with Competing Surveys</h3>
            <p>Several surveys address phishing detection, such as Khonji et al. (2013) and Borate et al. (2024), which focus on ML techniques and feature sets. However, this survey is distinct in its emphasis on the interplay between HPC and ML for phishing detection. Unlike previous works that broadly cover phishing detection methods, this survey specifically explores how HPC architectures (e.g., distributed pipelines, cloud HPC) enhance the scalability, speed, and real-time capabilities of ML models in phishing detection. Additionally, it provides tutorial introductions and highlights open research questions to guide future work in this niche intersection.</p>

<h2>5. Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in This Survey</h2>
<div class="section">
    <h3>5.1. How LLMs Were Employed</h3>
    <p>In developing this survey project, I utilized Grok, an AI created by xAI, to assist with specific tasks related to the creation and maintenance of this website. Grok was used for the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Writing the HTML for the Website:</strong> Grok helped generate and refine the HTML structure of this website (`index.html`), ensuring it was well-organized and functional for presenting the survey content.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixing Grammar Issues:</strong> Grok assisted in identifying and correcting grammar issues in the text content of the website, such as the introductory paragraphs and section descriptions, to improve readability and professionalism.</li>
        <li><strong>Formatting and Styling:</strong> Grok provided suggestions for the CSS styling and HTML formatting, helping to create a clean, visually appealing, and readable presentation of the survey website.</li>
        <li><strong>Troubleshooting Website Issues:</strong> Grok helped debug the 404 errors for the PDF links by suggesting adjustments to file paths, case sensitivity, and GitHub Pages configuration, ensuring the website was fully functional for grading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All content generated or edited by Grok was reviewed by me to ensure accuracy and originality. The surveyed papers do not discuss the use of LLMs for phishing detection; they focus on traditional ML models, deep learning (e.g., CNNs, RNNs), and Transformer-based models like BERT, which are distinct from generative LLMs like Grok.</p>
    <h3>5.2. Pros of Using LLMs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficiency in HTML Development:</strong> Grok saved significant time by drafting and refining the HTML code for the website, allowing me to focus on the content and structure of the survey.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Writing Quality:</strong> Grok’s grammar corrections enhanced the clarity and professionalism of the website’s text, making it more suitable for an academic audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Visual Presentation:</strong> Grok’s suggestions for CSS styling and formatting resulted in a more polished and user-friendly website design, improving the overall user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Effective Troubleshooting:</strong> Grok’s guidance in resolving the 404 errors ensured that all PDF links were accessible, making the website fully functional for the professor’s grading.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5.3. Cons of Using LLMs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk of Incorrect Suggestions:</strong> Grok occasionally suggested HTML or CSS code that needed adjustments to work correctly, requiring me to verify and test the changes to ensure functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Grammar Fixes Required Context:</strong> While Grok helped with grammar, some corrections needed manual adjustment to fit the technical context of the survey, as Grok sometimes missed the intended meaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Debugging Context:</strong> Grok lacked direct access to my GitHub repository, so troubleshooting the 404 errors required multiple iterations of feedback and adjustments, which was time-consuming.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependence on Oversight:</strong> I had to carefully review Grok’s HTML, grammar, and styling suggestions to ensure they met the project requirements and maintained originality, adding to my workload.</li>
    </ul>
